// Open your Android Studio project and make sure that your Project is of the type Android.
//If it is not Android then select Android from the drop-down list. This is not necessary but will make it easier to search for the files and directories needed.

//Now click on the strong>app directory and then click on the mipmap folder.
//The order would be: app > mipmap.

//Make sure that the image of the icon is already present on the computer.
//Find the path of the image and paste it.

//Now once we have our icon at the desired location and we know the path,
right click on the mipmap directory and then click on New and choose Image Asset from the drop-down menu. The order of actions would be:
mipmap(Right click) > New > Image Asset

//Give the location to the image icon in Path under Source Asset.
//If required, the image can be resized using the Resize option or change the color of our logo by heading to the Background Layer option.
Once all the required changes are made, we will click on the Next button and then on Finish and then the icon of the app will be changed!
